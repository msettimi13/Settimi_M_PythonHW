# Rock Paper Scissors - Python text-based take on a classic!

#### Pick your weapon and play against the computer - you'll only get a virtual sting if you lose!

All you need is [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to play.

The rules are the same as the classic game:

1. Paper covers Rock
2. Scissors cuts Paper
3. Rock smashes Scissors

Choose your weapon wisely!

The computer chooses first; just follow the prompts.
